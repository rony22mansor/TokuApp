Toku is a Japanese language teaching application built based on Tharwat Sami's videos with modification to the audio playback code to suit the new version of the AudioPlayers package.    <br />

## About The Project
I noticed that many Flutter learners, especially those learning from Tharwat Sami's course, had a problem with Toku's Japanese language app.
The reason for this problem is that the AudioPlayers package got many updates from the time Tharwat recorded the videos, so there was a difference in the way the package features are used.

What I did was read the documents of the package with its new version and its application, and I put comments to show the differences from the Tharwat code in the following files:

* lib\screens\colors_page.dart
* lib\widgets\item.dart


**The app ran successfully on:**
1. Mobile emulator
2. Browser (Edge and Chrome)
3. My phone (Redmi Note 8)
